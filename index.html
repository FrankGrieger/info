            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi there! My name is Frank.</p>
            <p>I'm a physicist with a PhD in astro physics and a computer scientist. My passion lies in understanding the fundamental laws of nature, 
               and I'm known for my strong analytical mind. During my academic journey, I specialized in developing image analysis software for the 
               prestigious Max Planck Institute for radio astronomy in Bonn.
            </p>
            <p>Now, I'm channeling my expertise as a product manager at a software company, where I get to work on exciting and innovative solutions 
               for our customers. It's incredible how my background in both physics and computer science allows me to approach challenges from unique angles.
            </p>
            <p>Beyond the world of physics and software, you'll find me indulging in my passions for photography and astronomy during my free time. 
               There's nothing quite like capturing stunning images of the world around me or exploring the vastness of the universe through my trusty telescope.
            </p>
            <p>The mysteries of quantum mechanics and the mind-bending curvature of spacetime described by general relativity never fail to fascinate me. 
               It's a thrill to ponder the mysteries of the cosmos.
            </p>
            <p>When I'm not immersed in work or my hobbies, I love to unwind with a good movie or lose myself in the rhythm of some heavy metal music. 
               Headbanging has its own unique way of releasing stress!
            </p>
            <p>Through this website, I hope to share a glimpse of who I am and the things that light up my life. So, feel free to explore and get to 
               know me a little better. Thanks for stopping by!</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li id="photography">Photography</li>
                <p>Photography is a great hobby because it allows me to capture and preserve memories, document my life and the world around me, 
                and express my creativity.</p>
                <p>With a camera and some basic technical skills, I can capture and share beautiful, meaningful,
                and interesting images with my family and friends. Photography can also help me develop a keen eye for composition, light, and color, and allow
                me to appreciate the beauty and uniqueness of the world in a deeper way.</p>
                <p>In addition, photography is a social and collaborative activity, as I can join photography events,
                workshops, or online communities to share my work, get feedback, and learn from others. It can also be a
                therapeutic and meditative activity, as I can find peace and inspiration in the process of taking and editing photos.</p>
                <p>Overall, photography is a versatile and rewarding hobby.</p>
                <li id="astronomy">Astronomy</li>
                <p>I have always been fascinated by the mysteries of the universe, and that's why I pursued a PhD in astro-physics at the European Southern Observatory. During my time there, I had the opportunity to work on cutting-edge research and learn from some of the top experts in the field. Now, in my free time, I continue to indulge my love for astronomy as a hobby.</p>
                <p>With a telescope and my extensive knowledge of astronomy, I can observe and study celestial objects such as stars, planets, galaxies, nebulae, and comets, and learn about their properties, behaviors, and histories. I also enjoy attending stargazing events, joining astronomy clubs or online communities, and participating in citizen science projects to share my observations and collaborate with others.</p>
                <p>Astronomy is also a great way for me to connect with nature and the environment, as I can learn about the seasons, the phases of the Moon, and the constellations, and appreciate the beauty and importance of the night sky.</p>
                <p>I find astronomy to be a fascinating and rewarding hobby that inspires my curiosity, creativity, and sense of awe and wonder.</p>

            <h2>Favorite Things</h2>
            <ul>
                <li id="movies">Movies</li>
                <p>In addition to epic fantasy, I enjoy suspense and horror movies, as long as they are not just gratuitous violence or shock. I appreciate well-crafted suspenseful plots, interesting and complex characters, and meaningful themes or messages. I also enjoy being scared or surprised in a way that makes me think or feel, rather than just trying to gross me out or shock me.</p>
                <li id="metal">Heavy Metal Music</li>
                <p>I am a fan of heavy metal music, and I especially enjoy the energy and aggression of melodic death metal. My favorite band in this genre is Arch Enemy, whose music combines technical virtuosity, melodic hooks, and powerful vocals with lyrics that explore themes of rebellion, defiance, and self-empowerment.</p>
                <p>I have been listening to Arch Enemy for many years and I have had the opportunity to see them live several times, including at the Wacken Open Air festival, which is one of the largest and most famous metal festivals in the world. Their concerts are always intense, energetic, and memorable, and their music has had a great influence on my own musical tastes and preferences.</p>
                <p>If you are also a fan of heavy metal music, I highly recommend checking out Arch Enemy's music. You can find their homepage and more information about their music and tours <a href="https://archenemy.net/">here</a>.</p>
